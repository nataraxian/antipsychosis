# Claude Code Notes

## Current Feature: Devcontainer Setup

Setting up devcontainer configuration for the fullstack template with desktop-lite feature for browser access in GitHub Codespaces.

## Progress Status
- ✅ Created `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` with Ubuntu base image
- ✅ Configured Node.js feature with pnpm support
- ✅ Added desktop-lite feature (browser access on port 6080, VNC on 5901)
- ✅ Included VS Code extensions from `.vscode/extensions.json`
- ✅ Set up updateContentCommand with tmux, jq, Claude Code, and Playwright Chrome
- ✅ Moved work to feature branch for testing

## Commits Made During Session
- d13bd12: feat: add devcontainer configuration with desktop-lite feature
- 25f13b3: refactor: use updateContentCommand instead of postCreateCommand

## Configuration Details
- Base: Ubuntu latest with Node.js feature from devcontainers/features
- Desktop: noVNC web access (port 6080), VNC (port 5901), password: vscode
- CLI Tools: tmux (for background sessions), jq (JSON parsing)
- Browser: Chrome installed via Playwright for testing
- Extensions: All recommendations from existing .vscode/extensions.json
- Command: Using updateContentCommand (better for templates than postCreateCommand)

## Next Steps
- Manual testing needed (requires actual devcontainer environment)
- Ready for additional commit with updateContentCommand change
